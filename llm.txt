# The used LLM tool
Microsoft Copilot with TUNI account (school or work account)

# General motivation for using LLM
Assists in answering questions when a simple web search don't yield results.

# How and why LLM helped
I have used LLMs in the following cases, I will explain how and why they helped alongside the cases:
- Help figure out certain a command: npx gitignore node:
    How: Asked for command to generate node ignore file.
    Why: Web search didn't return this command, while I figure there is a command for this purpose
        because I know there is one for dotnet (dotnet new gitignore).
- Help generate template for node:
    How: simply asking for simple pure node HTTP server template .
    Why: Web search kept returning node express examples.


# What kind of mistakes LLM did:
I do not recall mistakes with my use cases.

# What were things that LLM was not able to provide:
I did not run into LLM limitation because I avoid using LLMs.

# Extra notes:
In the other cases when I needed help, like extracting system information, docker files,
    compose files, etc. Web search was used. Plus, I do not use Github copilot,
